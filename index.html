   <h2 class="specific-font">Stingrays: An Introduction</h2>
   <main class="specific-font">
    Stingrays are beautiful marine creatures that come in all different shapes, size and colors. They can solitary or swim as a massive group that can only be seen through aerial photographs. With the related death of Steve Irwin, stingrays get a bad rap, but Irwin would be the first to tell you how incredible these creatures are.

   <h2 class="specific-font">Stingrays: the Basics</h2>
   <body class="specific-font">
       Stingrays are sea rays, a type of cartilaginous fish that is part of the class Elasmobranchii, which includes sharks, rays and skates. This class is characterized by several features:
       <ul>
           <li>Skeleton is made of cartilage rather than bone </li>
            <li>Five to seven gill openings on each side </li>
            <li>Rigid dorsal fins (and spines if present)</li>
            <li>Spiracles to aid in breathing</li>
            <li>Placoid scales (dermal denticles)</li>
            <li>An upper jaw of that is not fused to the skull.</li>
            <li>Elasmobranchs have several rows of teeth which are continually replaced.</li>
            <li> They don&apos;t have swim bladders, but instead their large livers are full of oil to provide buoyancy.</li>
            <li>Elasmobranchs reproduce sexually with internal fertilization and either bear live young or lay eggs.</li>
       </ul>
       They can be found in both fresh and saltwater, as well as different water sources, such as rivers, coastal areas and open oceans. Stingrays mostly feed on molluscs, crustaceans and occasionally small fish or insects, depending on their native habitat. They have developed several adaptations to better find their prey. The first of these adaptations are electrical sensors located around the mouth of the ray called the ampullae of Lorenzini. These electrical sensors allow the rays to sense the natural electrical charges of their prey and zero in on their location. Sharks also have these sensors and have been known to travel thousands of miles to the nursery they were born in to give birth solely based on the magnetic signature of their home nursery. Larger open water rays use a technique called &quot;Ram feeding&quot; to swim through large patches of plankton quickly and suck in the plankton as they swim. &quot;Benthic&quot; or floor-dwelling rays have been known to use a technique called &quot;tenting&quot;, which involved creating a tent-like shape with their body on the ocean floor and creating suction to pull their under them and into their mouth.

   <h2 class="specific-font">Are Stingrays Dangerous?</h2>
   <p class="specific-font">The short answer is yes, in the sense that all wild animals are dangerous if threatened. But are stingrays really dangerous? They are not aggressive, incapable of biting like a shark, and only use their tails when threatened. Stingrays do have barbs on their tails for defense, but these are usually only used if the animal is backed into a corner, or by accident if stepped upon. These barbs can be venomous, and usually lodge in the place when stuck. Stingray barb injuries are very painful, but usually not life-threatening, unless they become impaled in place of a vital organ, and these kinds of injuries are very rare. Steve Irwin&apos;s death was the only the second fatality cause by a stingray in Australian waters since 1945.
       There are some steps that can be taken to avoid these injuries. If you are swimming in waters that are known to have stingrays, do the &quot;Stingray shuffle&quot; and shuffle your feet through the sand while you walk. Many rays bury themselves in the sand for protection and this alerts them to your presence so they can swim away. If someone is unlucky enough to get barbed by a stingray, do not remove the barb!. To stop the venom, hot water can be applied to the area, as hot as the victim can stand without actually burning them. This should break down the enzymes in the venom. However, the true best course of action is to see a doctor immediately.

    <article>
        <ul>
            <li> Bottom dwelling rays have two separate opening to take in water: gills, located on the bottom of their body and spiracles, openings behind the eyes, which are used to breathe from when they are camouflaged on the ground.</li>
            <li> Stingrays are ovoviviparous, meaning they give birth to live young, sometimes in litters from 5 to 13.</li>
            <li> There are 220 known species of stingray, and many are endangered or threatened.</li>
